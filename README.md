# Predict-Vehicle-Accidents-in-New-Zealand
In this project, I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the major factors where accidents are likely to occur such as Number of Lanes, Traffic, Weather. Also, I have built and trained a Random Forest model to predict the fatal count achieving a  RMSE of 0.04. The New Zealand Crash Analysis System has been used for this project.
